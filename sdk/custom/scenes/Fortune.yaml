                power of the ancient dragon. Much to your dismay, the townspeople
                fall into dispute over who will receive the honor of riding the dragon
                first. You return home from your quest without everlasting glory or
                a dragon.

                are finally able to communicate with each other and resolve their
                disputes. You will complete your quest to restore peace in the town.
                The translator will be used on many other journeys across the
                earth. After its work is done, it retires honorably to a premier location
                in the Gryffinberg History Museum.

                of Gryffinberg. Among its infinite stacks of dusty books, you find
                one entitled “Wisdom of the Ages”. By the time you’ve read the 50,000-page
                tome, the townspeople have forgotten their problems. You will write
                a second edition of “Wisdom of the Ages”, but have limited commercial
                success.
